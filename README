This project is a simple single threaded distributed key value store which replicates put requests across the nodes in the cluster

Compilation Steps:
Install maven cli
Run >> mvn clean install

How to run multiple instance of the application in different ports?
>>mvn -Dmaven.tomcat.port={PORT_NO} tomcat:run-war
eg: mvn -Dmaven.tomcat.port=8080 tomcat:run-war

Steps to produce the replication behavior
1. Launch node1 using the command mvn -Dmaven.tomcat.port=8080 tomcat:run-war
2. Launch node2 using the command mvn -Dmaven.tomcat.port=8081 tomcat:run-war
3. Register the replica node info to each other using the API "/registerreplicanode"
4. Perform GET and POST operations on any of the running replicas and see the data getting repliacted to all the other nodes in the cluster
